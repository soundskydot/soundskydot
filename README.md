-- Listen to Earn -- 
Solution for music's royalty distribution. 

Problem:
The music industry, especially in Indonesia, always experiences problems due to royalty payments which are complained about by a number of songwriters who are members 
of the All Indonesian Composers Association (AKSI). They even introduced a new system called Digital Direct License (DDL) so that royalty payments no longer need to 
go through the National Collective Management Institute (LMKN), which is considered problematic. Many singers and songwriters have clashed to the point of giving each 
other lawsuits over the issue of incomplete royalty payments.

Sample:
Ahmad Dhani with Once Mekel, 
Posan Tobing with the band Kotak, 
Rieka Roslan with The Groove,
Ndhank Surahman with Andre Taulany and Stinky.
